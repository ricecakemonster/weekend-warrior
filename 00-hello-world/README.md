# Hello World

Write a program that greets the user by name, or by saying "Hello, World!" if no name is given.


## Specification

The `Hello World!` program will greet me, the caller.

If I tell the program my name is _Alice_, it will greet me by saying _Hello, Alice!_.

If I neglect to give it my name, it will greet me by saying _Hello, World!_.
